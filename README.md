## üìä Overview

This project explores transactional sales data from three Walmart branches using SQL. The main goal is to extract insights on sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance to inform strategic decision-making. This end-to-end analysis is inspired by a hands-on walkthrough and extended with custom SQL-driven feature engineering and visual insights.
